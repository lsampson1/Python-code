ErrorEstimation Python Code

CLT.py :- Central Limit Theorem experiments.

CLT-real.py :- CLT experiment with real data.

Computational cost.py :- Read .txt files from output of IPA/HL, display relative computational cost.

Convergence.py :- Read the outputs of the IPA/HL and calculate the "convergence" between 100% and N%.

Gridded H-L.py :- Produce the error variance and length-scale ratio by the Hollingsworth and Lonnberg, on a coarse grid.

Gridded IPA.py :- Produce the error variance and length-scale ratio by the Inner Product Analysis, on a coarse grid.

Non-gridded IPA.py :- Produce the error variance and length-scale ratio by the Inner Product Analysis, with real locations.

Non-gridded ANI.py :- Experimental anisotropic applications for IPA with 2D, anistropic distance.

Plot.py :- Produce a plot for the IPA/HL results, also translate into model grid resolution, produce netcdf file and move into ocean.

Preprocess.py :- Prepare the relevant files from the feedback data, rossby radius, depth profiles and model grid definitions.
